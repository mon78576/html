   -always keep playing if you mess up
   
   -never say you can't do it without even trying to do something
   
   -persistance
   
   -have a blank mind at times but also find the right time to help people also
   
   -focus on one line and repeat repeat repeat so that you can crack it down
   
   -get help also but ask not much for the understanding in your mind as well
   
   -have fun with playing the instrament
   
   -in the instrament isn't to your liking, find one that you think is best suited for you.
